I wrote the code contained in this repository's notebook to better obtain all Florida WARN notices. These notices, which companies meeting certain conditions are required to post when affecting a certain number of employees, are available on a government website, but the data is not available there in a format conducive to statistical analysis. By scraping the key data points of each notice into a dataframe, it is easy to put each notice within the context of its region, corporation, industry and timing.
